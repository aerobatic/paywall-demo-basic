  <h1>Premium learning content</h1>
  <p>This site is a demonstration Jekyll site that showcases how to build a membership based site that requires a paid subscription to access premium content. There is both free lesson content that is available to anyone, and premium lesson content that requires membership.</p>

  <!--
  Content in the /free-lessons/* directory is outside of the paywalled section of the site, so it
  can be accessed by the general public.
  -->
  {% assign free_lessons = site.pages | where: "free_lesson", true | sort: "title" %}
  <h2>Free Lessons</h2>
  <ul class="post-list">
    {% for lesson in free_lessons %}
      <li>
        <h3>
          <a class="post-link" href="{{ lesson.url | relative_url }}">
            {{ lesson.title | escape }}
          </a>
        </h3>
        <p>{{ lesson.description }}</p>
      </li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>

  <h2>Premium Lessons</h2>  
  <p>Upon clicking any of the premium lesson links below, if the user is not yet logged-in, they will first be prompted to register. After registering they will be presented with a link to purchase a subscription.</p>

    Any page nested within the /members/* directory requires the user to
    be both logged-in and have the "subscriber" role.
